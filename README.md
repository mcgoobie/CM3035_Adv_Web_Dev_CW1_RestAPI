The objective of this project was to develop a backend to help pull and update existing protein sequences in a given dataset. Different routes
conforming to RESTful API were created to help with the necessary requests to send and responses to be received.

In addition to the task aforementioned above, a Python script was also developed to ingest the .csv dataset into a SQLite3 database.

The features of this application were,
- Addition of new proteins (POST Request),
- Fetching of protein sequences (GET Request),
- Fetching of protein domain (GET Request),
- Fetching of protein list of an organism (GET Request),
- Fetching the domain list in all proteins for an organism(GET Request),
- Finding the protein coverage (GET Request).

A video demonstration of this application and its features can be viewed below,
